## Usage

### Loans

![Loans](images/loans.png)

Launch the OverDrive Libby plugin, and click on the "Loans" tab. 

~~Select the loans you wish to download, then click on the "Download" button.~~

~~Each selected loan will then be downloaded in its own calibre job. When the job completes, the loan book file should be in your library.~~

~~Only downloadable loans will be listed. If the loan does not have a downloadable format, or has previously been sent to your Kindle, it will not be shown unless "Include titles without downloadable formats" is enabled in setup.~~

Automatic downloads are no longer supported. You can open the loan directly in the libbyapp.com website and you can currently download ebooks for use with Adobe Digital Editions from there.


Select a row, right-click and select the appropriate action to:
- Return a loan
- View the title on the Libby/OverDrive site
- Read with Kindle (if available)
- View book details (also accesible by double-clicking on the row)
- Copy the Libby share link
- Search for selected book in your calibre library
- Search with the selected book title and author
- Renew/place a hold for an expiring loan

#### Format Locking

Libby does not allow users to read a loan on a Kindle and still download the title as an `.acsm`/`.epub`.

If you chose to read with a Kindle, the loan will not be available for download (the loan is locked to the Kindle format). Similarly, if you chose to download the `.acsm`/`.epub`, the loan becomes locked to the acsm/epub format and will not be available for reading on a Kindle.

Removing a book from the Kindle/ADE/calibre does not "unlock" the loan. To do that, you have to return and borrow the book again.

### Holds

![Holds](images/holds.png)

Select the "Holds" tab. Select the available hold you wish to borrow, then click on the Borrow button.

Each selected hold will then be borrowed in its own job. When the job completes, click the "Refresh" button to see the new loan in the "Loans" tab.

Alternatively, right-click on the Borrow button to choose the "Borrow and Download" action. This will borrow and download the selected hold.

To list unavailable holds, uncheck the "Hide unavailable holds" checkbox.

Select a row, right-click and select the appropriate action to:
- Cancel a hold
- Suspend/delay delivery for a hold ("Manage hold")

![Edit Hold](images/edit_hold.png)

### Magazines

![Magazines](images/magazines.png)

Select the "Magazines" tab. From this tab, you can add magazines to monitor for new issues.

From the Libby/OverDrive site, copy the URL of the magazine you want to monitor. Paste the URL into the textbox, and select the Card to use for future borrowing. Then click on the "Add" button.

The title will then be listed below with its details. To borrow a title, select the row and click on the Borrow button.

To stop monitoring a title, select and right-click on the row, then select "Cancel".

### Search

![Search](images/search.png)

The "Search" tab provides a basic search function across your libraries. The libraries to search and the number of results returned can be customised in setup. To borrow or place a hold, select a title, then click on the Hold or Borrow button and select the card you wish to use.

### Cards

![Cards](images/cards.png)

The "Cards" tab provides an overview of the linked cards in your Libby account. Right-click on the Library name, Loans, or Holds to view the respective pages on OverDrive or Libby.

## FAQ

### `[SSL: CERTIFICATE_VERIFY_FAILED] certificate verify failed` error on Windows

Download the Let's Encrypt R3 certificate https://letsencrypt.org/certs/lets-encrypt-r3.der. Import it into the Windows certificate store by double-clicking on the file and follow the subsequent prompts.

### Why can't I see my all loans?

If you wish to see loans that are not fully downloadable (e.g. Kindle loans, audibooks), enable the "Include titles without downloadable formats" option in setup.

### Why is a loan downloaded without any formats (acsm/epub)?

This is because the loan does not have a supported downloadable format available. The loan is either not available in epub/pdf, or you have chosen to Read with Kindle (see above for details about [Format Locking](#format-locking)).

### Why can't I download a magazine?

Libby no longer allow magazines to be downloaded.
